                <h2>Collection types</h2>
                <dl>
                    <dt>extensional</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Type of virtual collection that explicitly enumerates the references to resources or metadata documents that make up the collection
                        <dl>
                            <dt>resources</dt>
                            <dd>
                                The members that make up an extensional virtual collection by means of a persistent reference.
                                These members may be of type <em>metadata</em> for referencing metadata, or <em>resource</em> for directly referencing a resource.
                            </dd>
                        </dl>
                    </dd>

                    <dt>intensional</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Type of virtual collection that defines a query by which the items of the collection can be retrieved ad-hoc from a secondary service <em>(experimental, use at own risk!)</em>
                        <dl>
                            <dt>query description</dt>
                            <dd>
                                A prose description of the procedure by which the collection items can be retrieved from the external service.
                            </dd>
                            <dt>query URI</dt>
                            <dd>
                                The location of the service from which the items should be retrieved. This value may be a persistent identifier, but could also be a plain URI although this is advised against for published collections.
                            </dd>
                            <dt>query profile</dt>
                            <dd>
                                Identifier of the mechanism, i.e. the protocol to be used, by which the members of the virtual collection should be retrieved. A application exploiting the query can use this to use a proper driver to talk to the service. Example: In case of CLARIN-FCS access the endpoint by FCS-compatible means.
                            </dd>
                            <dt>query value</dt>
                            <dd>
                                The query that should be passed on to the service by which it can look up the items that are part of this collection. This value should be in the query language supported by the service. Example: In case of CLARIN-FCS, this value is the CQL query to be send to the endpoint.
                            </dd>
                        </dl>
