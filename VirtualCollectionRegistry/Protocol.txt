Virtual Collection Registry RESTful web service
===============================================

The Virtual Collection Registry (VCR) provides a RESTful web service for
working with the registry.


1. Prerequisite

    a) Internal XML format for virtual collections:
       A virtual collection is represented in an internal XML format, which is
       defined by the W3C XML schema "VirtualCollection.xsd" found in the
       "src/resources/META-INF" directory.
       
    b) The VCR relies on various HTTP headers:
        - "Content-Type" must be set for POST and PUT requests. Accepted
          values are "text/xml", "application/xml" or "application/json".
        - "Accept" can be used all requests. Accepted values are "text/xml",
          "application/xml" or "application/json". If the header is not set,
          the VCR assumes "application/xml" as default.
        - Headers for HTTP Basic Auth need to be set on POST, PUT and DELETE
          requests.      


2. RESTful web service operations

    The following describes the RESTful web service operations. The URIs are
    relative to a base URI ($BASE), which depends on the machine, where the
    VCR is installed.

    a) Create a virtual collection (POST) 
                 description: A virtual collection will be created based on the
                              representation of the virtual collection sent in
                              the request body.
                 HTTP method: POST
                         URI: $BASE/service/virtualcollection
         URI path parameters: none
            query parameters: none 
                HTTP headers: Content-Type (required), Accept (optional)
              authentication: required
                request body: Depending on Content-Type header either a valid
                              XML instance or the JSON representation of a
                              virtual collection conforming to the above
                              mentioned XML schema. The root element is expected
                              to be "VirtualCollection"
                 result body: Depending on Accept header either an XML instance
                              or the JSON representation of the outcome of the
                              request. If successful, the result will contain
                              the ID of the created virtual collection

    b) Update a virtual collection (PUT)
                 description: The virtual collection identified by the URI will
                              be updated, actually replaced, with the
                              representation of the virtual collection sent in
                              the request body.
                 HTTP method: PUT
                         URI: $BASE/service/virtualcollection/$id
         URI path parameters: $id := is the ID of the virtual collection,
                                     which is to be changed
            query parameters: none 
                HTTP headers: Content-Type (required), Accept (optional)
              authentication: required
                request body: Depending on Content-Type header either a valid
                              XML instance or the JSON representation of a
                              virtual collection conforming to the above
                              mentioned XML schema. The root element is expected
                              to be "VirtualCollection"
                 result body: Depending on Accept header either an XML instance
                              or the JSON representation of the outcome of the
                              request.

    c) Delete a virtual collection (DELETE)
                 description: The virtual collection referenced by the URI will
                              be deleted.
                 HTTP method: DELETE
                         URI: $BASE/service/virtualcollection/$id
         URI path parameters: $id := is the ID of the virtual collection,
                                     which is to be deleted
            query parameters: none
                HTTP headers: Accept (optional)
              authentication: required
                request body: none
                 result body: depending on Accept header either an XML instance
                              or the JSON representation of the outcome of the
                              request.

    d) Retrieve a virtual collection (GET)
                 description: The virtual collection referenced by the URI will
                              be retrieved.
                 HTTP method: GET
                         URI: $BASE/service/virtualcollection/$id
         URI path parameters: $id := is the ID of the virtual collection,
                                     which is to be retrieved
            query parameters: none
                HTTP headers: Accept (optional)
              authentication: not required
                request body: none
                 result body: Depending on Accept header either an XML instance
                              or the JSON representation of the virtual
                              collection. If the virtual collection is not found
                              the appropriate HTTP status code is issued and an
                              error message is returned.

    e) Retrieve all / search virtual collections (GET)
                 description: All virtual collections will be retrieved; if a
                              query expression is used, only the virtual
                              collections satisfying the query will be
                              retrieved.

                              collection. If the virtual collection is not found
                              the appropriate HTTP status code is issued and an
                              error message is returned.

    f) Retrieve all / search virtual collection owned by the user (GET)
                 description: All virtual collections owned by the authenticated
                              user will be retrieved; if a query expression is
                              used, only the virtual collections satisfying the
                              query will be retrieved.
                 HTTP method: GET
                         URI: $BASE/service/my-virtualcollections

              authentication: required
                request body: none
                 result body: Depending on Accept header either an XML instance

                              the appropriate HTTP status code is issued and an
                              error message is returned.

                 result body: The virtual collection in CMDI format If the
                              virtual collection is not found the appropriate
                              HTTP status code is issued and an error message
                              is returned.


3. Virtual Collection Query language (VCRQL)
     query            = expression
                      | expression 'and' expression
                      | expression 'or' expression

     expression       = component '=' value
                      | component '!=' value

     component        = 'vc'      '.' vc-property
                      | 'creator' '.' creator-property

     vc-property      = 'name' | 'description'

     creator-property = 'name' | 'email' | 'organization'
      
     value            = double quoted string value, use backslash
                        for escaping double quotes, use "*" and "?" for
                        wildcards.
